# Nexus LITE by Xeon

Thank you for downloading Nexus LITE by Xeon. Please review the following information and requirements to get started.

## Requirements

- **Node.js:** Version **v20.12.0** or later is required.  
- **Discord.js:** Version **14.0.0** or later is needed.  
  *Note: Node.js must be installed before the bot, and Discord.js will be installed during the bot setup process.*

## Compatibility

- This bot has been developed and tested on:
  - **Windows Server 2022**
  - **Windows 10**

Usage on Linux or other versions of Windows may vary or not function as expected.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Discord Developer Portal Setup:**
   - Create an application with the proper permissions.
   - Add the application to your server.
   - If you are unsure about the permissions, set it to **Administrator** and ensure the bot's role is as high as possible in the role hierarchy.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create the `.env` file to include your:
     - Bot token
     - Application client ID
     - Operator ID (this should be a Discord user ID representing the host, developer, etc.)
     - The Operator ID grants access to the command reload functions.
    - Sample:
     ```
     BOT_TOKEN=Token_From_Dev_Portal
     CLIENT_ID=Client_ID_From_Dev_Portal
     OPERATOR=Owner_or_Developer_ID
     ```

3. **Bot Configuration:**
   - While a basic understanding of JavaScript is recommended, it is not required.
   - The bot is deployable out-of-the-box. However, it is recommended to customize the bot as much as possible.

4. **Logger and Info Command:**
   - The logger file and info command are obfuscated to prevent easy modifications or removal of credits.
   - Although this project is open source, a mark of ownership is retained. Overcoming the obfuscation is a challenge ‚Äì if you manage to defeat it, you win and may change the credits in the info command as you please! That said, please leave this file and inline credits intact.

5. **Installation on Windows:**
   - **Download and Install Node.js:**  
     Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest LTS version.
   - **Clone the Repository:**

     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
